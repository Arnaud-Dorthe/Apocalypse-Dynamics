This is a short installation and simulation guide to the Apocalypse Dynamics model.

To know more about the Apocalypse Dynamics, have a look to the [Github Wiki tab](https://github.com/Arnaud-Dorthe/ApocalypseDynamics/wiki).
To know more about the projects roadmap and progress reports, click on the [Github Projects tab](https://github.com/Arnaud-Dorthe/ApocalypseDynamics/projects), and select a project.

First of all, [download the OpenModelica version for your favorite operating system](https://www.openmodelica.org/download/download-linux).

Then download the Apocalypse Dynamics package, either by [direct download](https://github.com/Arnaud-Dorthe/ApocalypseDynamics/archive/master.zip) if you are a novice, or [through Git](https://github.com/Arnaud-Dorthe/ApocalypseDynamics.git) if you are an advanced user. If you are nor a novice nor a advanced user, but a average user who'd like to get his chance on Git, you may find helpful the [github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf](https://github.com/Arnaud-Dorthe/ApocalypseDynamics/blob/master/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf) in the root directory.

Having said that, start OpenModelica connection editor (OMEdit). 
In the File menu, open the Apocalypse dynamics package you have been downloading. 

Then select WorldDynamics, World3 and one of the scenarios, e.g. Scenario 2. 
Click on the right‐arrow (‐>) simulate button (top row) to simulate. 
To also simulate some other scenario, click on that one and click the simulate button.

To plot, click on one or more of the variables in the right window. You can search for population by typing popul You can simulate several scenarios and plot one or more variable from each simulation in the same diagram. Below from Scenario1, Scenario2, Scenario3.

This plot is from from Scenario2, Scenario3, and Scenario6. The green one ("green growth") was the only sustainable-one, that is to say without collapse, as of 2004.
