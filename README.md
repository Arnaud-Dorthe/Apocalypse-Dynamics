Free library for modeling according to the principles of system dynamics of J. Forrester.

## Library description

The Apocalypse-Dynamics library allows to model according to the principles of system dynamics originated by J.W. Forrester in the 1960's. The field of system dynamics is well established, hence, the novelty and value of this library is not to be seen in the modeling principles of system dynamics themselves, rather, in the combination of system dynamics modeling with the Apocalypse predicament.

The Apocalypse-Dynamics library takes advantage of the vast object-oriented, multi-formalism, physical modeling capabilities of Modelica.

System dynamics is widespread mainly in economics, management, biology and environmental areas. The SystemDynamics Modelica library paves the way for integrated treatment of socio-technical systems, having both continuous-time and discrete-event aspects. In addition, it is thought valuable to be able to use the System Dynamics modeling concept, which supports the "top-down" modeling approach, together with the inherent "bottom-up" approach of physical object-oriented modeling.

The documentation is included in the source code package.

#### Release notes
* [Version v2023]
 `ApocalypseDynamics 2023` is based on ApocalypseDynamics version 2022. It has been primarily updated in order to update the world 2021 model with a new scenario. This is the optimal scenario for a sustainable future. The ultimate scenario.
* [Version v2022]
   `ApocalypseDynamics 2022` is based on ApocalypseDynamics version 2021. It has been primarily updated in order to update the "world 2021" model with a new set of data regarding the greenhouse gaz pollution and the climate change's negative feedback on food production, industrial production, population growth.
* [Version v2021]
   `ApocalypseDynamics 2021` is based on ApocalypseDynamics version 2020. It has been primarily updated in order to update the "world 2020" model with a new set of data regarding energy production, fossil fuel stocks, renewable energies supply
* [Version v2020]
   `ApocalypseDynamics 2020` is based on SystemDynamics Version 2.1. It has been primarily updated in order to update the "world 3" scenariis of the limit to growth with the latest 2010s data on global population, natural ressources stocks, food supply, industrial production, economic development, pollution.
* [Version v2.1 (2013-10-16)](../../archive/v2.1.zip)
  * `SystemDynamics 2.1` is based on SystemDynamics Version 2.0 that was developed by Prof. Cellier and his students, and has been primarily updated in order for it to work with MSL 3.2.1. The diagrams have been corrected from the old graphical definitions and some icons have been added.
* [Version v2.0 (2007-09-13)](../../archive/v2.0.zip)
  * `SystemDynamics 2.0` constitutes a completely reworked release of the SystemDynamics library. This version is based in part on Version 1.0, and in part on a different and independently created version of a System Dynamics library for Dymola/Modelica, a version that had been developed by Prof. Cellier and his students at the University of Arizona, and had been around in a much reduced form since 2001.
* Version v1.0 (2002-04-09)
  * `SystemDynamics 1.0` constituted the first official release of the SystemDynamics library. That version was created by Stefan Fabricius in 2002, at a time when Stefan worked as a Ph.D. student at ETH Zurich.
