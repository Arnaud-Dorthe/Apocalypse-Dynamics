### User guide

#### Installation

 First of all, you must install a Modelica developping environment.
Download the free [OpenModelica](https://www.openmodelica.org/download/download-linux) environment from the official website.
Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

 Then download the Apocalypse Dynamics package, either by [direct download](https://github.com/Arnaud-Dorthe/ApocalypseDynamics/archive/master.zip) if you are a simple user, or [through Git](https://github.com/Arnaud-Dorthe/ApocalypseDynamics.git) if you want to contribute to the project. In the latter case, you need a Git client on your desktop. For your conveniance, I have added a [github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf](https://github.com/Arnaud-Dorthe/ApocalypseDynamics/blob/master/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf) in the root directory.

#### Simulation

Start OpenModelica connection editor (OMEdit). 
In the File menu, open the Apocalypse dynamics package you have been downloading. 

Then select WorldDynamics, World3 and one of the scenarios, e.g. Scenario 2. 
Click on the right‐arrow (‐>) simulate button (top row) to simulate. 
To simulate another scenario at the same time, click on that one and click the simulate button.

Go to the "Plotting" tab, click on one or more of the variables in the right window. You can search for population by typing "population". You can simulate several scenarios and plot one or more variables from each simulation in the same diagram. Here-below the worldwide population plots from Scenario1, Scenario2, Scenario3:

![Scenario1, Scenario2, Scenario3](UsersGuide/GitHub%20Images/Scenario1%2C%20Scenario2%2C%20Scenario3%20population.png)

The plots given below come from Scenario2, Scenario3, and Scenario6. The green one ("green growth") was the only sustainable-one, that is to say without population collapse, as of 2004.

Now it's your turn: try to find a sustainable scenario for our common future !

May the force of the Mathematics be with you ! :innocent:
