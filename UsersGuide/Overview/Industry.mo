This is the oldest application area of System Dynamics.  In fact, the System Dynamics methodology had been originally invented by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Wright_Forrester\">Jay Forrester</a> to describe processes of factory automation. <p>

Although this is the original application of the methodology, it is not commonly used today for such purposes.  Most people nowadays prefer a different world view for the description of factory automation processes, namely that of a <font color=red><b>process-oriented discrete event simulation</b></font>, as this world view allows us to study better phenomena such as <font color=red><b>deadlock</b></font> and <font color=red><b>starvation</b></font> in a system. <p>

Typical tools for such purposes would include <font color=red><b>ARENA</b></font>, and there exists also a <font color=red><b>Modelica</b></font> implementation of that tool and modeling methodology, called the <font color=red><b>ARENALib</b></font>. <p>
