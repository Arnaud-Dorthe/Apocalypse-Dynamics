<p><span style=\"color: #008000; font-size: large;\"><strong>System Dynamics</strong></span> is a modeling methodology designed by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Wright_Forrester\">Jay Forrester</a> in the 1960s and 1970s for modeling and simulating mass and information flows of continuous-time systems in the soft sciences.</p>
<p>It is a low-level modeling methodology.  The software behind this library is not more complex than that behind the Block library.  Thus, the value of this library is not so much in the software modules themselves as it is in the application examples.</p>
<p><span style=\"color: #008000; font-size: large;\"><strong>System Dynamics</strong></span> is important, because this modeling methodology is widely used by researchers in the life and social sciences.</p>
<p>The methodology is built around the concepts of Levels and Rates.  <strong>Levels</strong> are quantities that can be accumulated, whereas <strong>Rates</strong> are the quantities that control the increase and/or decrease of the Levels.</p>
<p>Typical examples of Levels and Rates are given in the graph below:</p>
<p><img src=\"modelica://SystemDynamics/Resources/Images/SD_Fig8.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>
<p>System Dynamics modelers are generally quite \"generous\" (sloppy) in the use of concepts.  This becomes clear when looking at the entries in the above table.</p>
<p>The Levels can be computed from the Rates by a simple differential equation:</p>
<p><img src=\"modelica://SystemDynamics/Resources/Images/SD_Fig10.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>
<p>The Rates are being controlled by a so-called laundry list, a set of influencing factors that control the rates.  Below is a table that provides a possible laundry list for the human birth rate in a population dynamics study:</p>
<p><img src=\"modelica://SystemDynamics/Resources/Images/SD_Fig9.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>
<p>There are usually many ways to model systems from soft sciences, i.e., different sets of variables constituting a laundry list may lead to quite similar simulation results in the end.</p>
<p>The Rates are usually determined by static non-linear functions of several variables, namely those listed in the laundry list:</p>
<p><img src=\"modelica://SystemDynamics/Resources/Images/SD_Fig11.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>
<p>Since it is too complicated to identify such a complicated function of multiple arguments, the System Dynamics methodology usually simplifies the functional relationship by assuming a multiplicative relationship between the different input variables:</p>
<p><img src=\"modelica://SystemDynamics/Resources/Images/SD_Fig12.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>
<p>The individual non-linear functions are now functions of a single argument.  They are usually identified from statistical information and are specified in the model as tabular functions.</p>
<p>A simple example of a System Dynamics model is shown below:</p>
<p><img src=\"modelica://SystemDynamics/Resources/Images/SD_Fig7.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>
<p>This example describes the savings of a person.  The savings (a variable that can be accumulated, i.e., a Level) is controlled by income and expenses (Rate variables).  There are several categories of income (salary and interest), whereby the interest is proportional to the savings.  There are also several categories of expenses, namely bank fees, taxes, utility bills, and cost-of-living expenses.  The bank fees are also proportional to the savings.  If the parameters are set correctly, the modeler can observe whether his or her savings will grow over time, or whether they will get depleted.  Mass flows are represented by lilac connections, whereas information flows are depicted in blue.  The two lilac clouds represent sources and sinks of masses.  These are dummy models in our library.  They were only provided to maintain the look-and-feel of the System Dynamics methodology.</p>
<p>Originally, System Dynamics models were usually encoded in <span style=\"color: red;\"><strong>Dynamo</strong></span>, a very simple alphanumeric modeling/simulation language that was in fact already outdated (in comparison with other modeling/simulation environments) at the time it was created.</p>
<p>With the advent of the Macintosh computer in the mid-eighties, <span style=\"color: red;\"><strong>Dynamo</strong></span> was rapidly replaced by <span style=\"color: red;\"><strong>STELLA</strong></span>, a graphical tool designed for representing System Dynamics models.</p>
<p>Although <span style=\"color: red;\"><strong>STELLA</strong></span> offers a graphical user interface, the tool has its drawbacks.  It is still a very simple environment.  It is not truly hierarchical, and worst of all, it doesn't offer means for <em>documenting</em> models.  Yet documentation is very important, especially in soft sciences.  What precisely does a particular variable mean?  How is it measured?  What measurement units are being used?  For an electrical resistor or a mechanical inertia, the answer to these questions may be obvious, but this is not the case for many of the soft-science models.</p>
<p>The <span style=\"color: red;\"><strong>SystemDynamics</strong></span> Modelica library offers some of the touch and feel of the <span style=\"color: red;\"><strong>STELLA</strong></span> software, while providing the modeler with the full power and flexibility of the <span style=\"color: red;\"><strong>Modelica</strong></span> environment.  Integration of the <span style=\"color: red;\"><strong>SystemDynamics</strong></span> Modelica library with other available <span style=\"color: red;\"><strong>Modelica</strong></span> libraries allows broadening the applications of the System Dynamics modeling paradigm to engineering domains. The multi-formalism and multi-domain capabilities of <span style=\"color: red;\"><strong>Modelica</strong></span> can be exploited to create models of complex and large socio-technical systems that have not been feasible using earlier implementations of the System Dynamics modeling methodology.

This is the oldest application area of System Dynamics.  In fact, the System Dynamics methodology had been originally invented by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Wright_Forrester\">Jay Forrester</a> to describe processes of factory automation. <p>

Although this is the original application of the methodology, it is not commonly used today for such purposes.  Most people nowadays prefer a different world view for the description of factory automation processes, namely that of a <font color=red><b>process-oriented discrete event simulation</b></font>, as this world view allows us to study better phenomena such as <font color=red><b>deadlock</b></font> and <font color=red><b>starvation</b></font> in a system. <p>

Typical tools for such purposes would include <font color=red><b>ARENA</b></font>, and there exists also a <font color=red><b>Modelica</b></font> implementation of that tool and modeling methodology, called the <font color=red><b>ARENALib</b></font>. <p>

<font color=red><b>Urban Dynamics</b></font> describes an application area that is located somewhere in between <font color=red><b>World Dynamics</b></font> and <font color=red><b>Industrial Dynamics</b></font>.  It includes application areas such as the studying of traffic flows in an inner city or along a freeway. <p>

Most people today prefer a different world view for the description of traffic flows in the inner city, namely that of a <font color=red><b>process-oriented discrete event simulation</b></font>, as this world view allows us to study better phenomena such as <font color=red><b>deadlock</b></font> and <font color=red><b>starvation</b></font> in a system. <p>

Typical tools for such purposes would include <font color=red><b>ARENA</b></font>, and there exists also a <font color=red><b>Modelica</b></font> implementation of that tool and modeling methodology, called the <font color=red><b>ARENALib</b></font>. <p>

Yet, for the study of traffic flow along a freeway, the System Dynamics approach might still be the preferred way of dealing with such problems. <p>

Whereas the discrete event world view follows an individual car through the system from one traffic light and intersection to the next, the System Dynamics world view discusses the problem at a slightly more aggregated level using traffic volume as its levels and traffic densities as its rates. <p>

The <font color=red><b>Modelica</b></font> implementations of the two methodologies would allow us to intersect discrete-event traffic models of an urban area with System-Dynamics traffic models of its surroundings.  This application represents current research and has not much been tackled so far. <p>

One of the most important applications of the System Dynamics methodology are the set of world models that were developed primarily by the M.I.T. group around Profs. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Wright_Forrester\">Jay Forrester</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Meadows\">Dennis Meadows</a>. <p>

Beside from the (meanwhile classical) world models, this view point would include models of climate dynamics, such as models of the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere; models of the melting of our glaciers accompanied by a rise of the waters of our seas; models of the spreading of pollutants through the atmosphere; models of the salination of our soil; and finally, models of the depletion of resources, such as sweet water for drinking and irrigation. <p>
